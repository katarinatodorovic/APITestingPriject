# APITestingProject

API REST skeleton used for this project can be found on: https://github.com/davellanedam/node-express-mongodb-jwt-rest-api-skeleton
The project consists of a collection of API requests divided in categories: Auth, city, profile, user
and a series of test scripts for each category. For every request several test scripts were written in order 
to validate responses. Every test script implemented Chai Assertion Library. The whole project 
was run on the local machine using MongoDB in conjunction with the Node.js to store and access data.
